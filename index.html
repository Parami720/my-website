      <h4>About Me</h4>
      <p>
        I am thrilled to introduce myself as a passionate and ambitious individual currently pursuing a BTech in Information Technology at the prestigious University of Kalyani. With a strong drive for excellence and a deep-rooted love for technology, I am on a mission to carve out a successful career in the world of software.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a second-year student, I am actively seeking exciting job opportunities and internships to further enhance my skills and gain practical industry experience. With a solid foundation in IT principles, programming languages, and software development methodologies, I am eager to put my knowledge into action and contribute to cutting-edge projects that shape the future.
      </p>  <p> 
        While technology is my primary focus, I also find solace in the world of performing arts. Singing and dancing are my creative outlets, allowing me to express myself beyond the realms of coding and algorithms. Just as software development requires precision and attention to detail, singing and dancing demand discipline and grace. Together, these two worlds merge seamlessly to create a unique blend of technical prowess and artistic flair.</p>  <p>
        
        I completed my secondary education at the prestigious Mahishadal Gayeswari Girls' High School, where I honed my academic skills and developed a strong foundation for my future endeavors. Later, I pursued my higher secondary education at Mahishadal Raj High School, where I further nurtured my passion for technology and expanded my horizons in the field of IT.</p>
        <p>
        With an unwavering determination to excel in the software industry, I am constantly seeking opportunities to learn, grow, and innovate. I believe that technology has the power to revolutionize the way we live, and I am driven to be a part of that transformation.
      </p><p>
        Thank you for visiting my website, and I invite you to explore my journey as I continue to strive for excellence in the ever-evolving world of software. Together, let's push boundaries, embrace innovation, and make a positive impact on the lives of people through the power of technology.
